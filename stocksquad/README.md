## Getting started and note to TA's

NOTE TO TA's:
To run the code, just cd into Source Files and type "make".

If you want terminal verison, just run ./a.out

If you want react version, run /usr/local/cs/cs251/bridge.py

## Our project

When you load into the GUI interface if you want to login into an existing account you can use the default username "user1" and password "pass1".

Or you could create a new account and go through that process (Note: username and password need to be at 4-16 characters long).

Once in the app, all buttons work and you can view every tab, but only the trading tab has been implemented as of now.

Once our done exploring the app you can hit the logout button located in the top left of the screen!

Thank you!
